# CSS Basics & The Box Model Assignment

This project was created for the **PLP Web Technologies Classroom – Introduction to CSS (July 2025)** assignment.

## Overview
The assignment demonstrates:
- Linking an external CSS file to HTML
- Using CSS properties such as color, font-size, margin, padding, border, and background
- Visualizing and experimenting with the **CSS Box Model**
- Creating simple layouts (cards, grids, navigation) without external libraries

## Files
- **index.html** – Basic HTML structure with header, sections, cards, and a playground for the box model
- **styles.css** – All styling rules, commented for clarity
- **README.md** – This file

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## Notes
- No JavaScript or external CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) are used.
- Inspect elements in browser dev tools to clearly see how margin, padding, and border affect layout.
